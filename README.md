# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis
Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning  The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and training a model to understand sentiment trends.

# Key Components:
Data Collection: Scraping tweets using the Twitter API or datasets.
Preprocessing: Cleaning text, removing stopwords, and tokenization.
Feature Extraction: Using techniques like TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT).
Model Training: Implementing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, or Transformers for sentiment classification.
Visualization & Insights: Analyzing trends to understand public opinion on various topics.

# Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
NLTK (Stopword Removal, Stemming)
Scikit-learn (Preprocessing, Train-Test Split)
Keras (Tokenization for ML Models)
WordCloud (Visualizing Most Common Words)

# Installation & Setup

python sentiment_analysis.py
Dataset
We use the Sentiment140 dataset containing 1.6 million labeled tweets with polarity labels:

0 → Negative 😠
2 → Neutral 😐
4 → Positive 😃

# Results

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing tweet distribution, common words, and character frequency
📈 Chi-square Analysis – Comparing observed vs. expected letter distributions
