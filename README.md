# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis
Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning  The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and training a model to understand sentiment trends.

# Key Components:
Data Collection: Scraping tweets using the Twitter API or datasets.
Preprocessing: Cleaning text, removing stopwords, and tokenization.
Feature Extraction: Using techniques like TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT).
Model Training: Implementing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, or Transformers for sentiment classification.
Visualization & Insights: Analyzing trends to understand public opinion on various topics.
